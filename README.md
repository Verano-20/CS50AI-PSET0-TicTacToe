# CS50AI-PSET0-TicTacToe
My solution for CS50AI pset0 - tic tac toe.

Using minimax to enable the program to calculate the best move for a given board state by simulating all potential future board states and finding the path which gives the highest or lowest guaranteed score.

No aplha-beta pruning implemented at present.
